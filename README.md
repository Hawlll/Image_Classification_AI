# Image Classification Model Training with TensorFlow

(`train_model.py`) trains an image classification model using the module TensorFlow. The model is trained on happy and sad images and predicts whether an input image is happy or sad.

## Prerequisites

Before running (`train_model.py`), make sure you have the required python libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV (cv2)
- imghdr
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

**NOTE**: Make sure you have Python 3.9 interpreter for Tensorflow GPU compatability.

You can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python imghdr matplotlib numpy
